As a security analyst, I need to provide a comprehensive assessment of the following integrated security alert:

Alert Summary:
Timestamp: {detection_result.get("timestamp", "Unknown")}
Total Anomalies: {detection_result.get("total_anomalies", 0)}
Severity: {detection_result.get("severity", "Unknown")}

Breakdown by Category:
- Process Anomalies: {detection_result.get("process_anomalies", 0)}
- Memory Anomalies: {detection_result.get("memory_anomalies", 0)}
- Disk Anomalies: {detection_result.get("disk_anomalies", 0)}
- Network Attacks: {detection_result.get("network_attacks", 0)}

Correlation Analysis:
Based on the pattern of anomalies across different system components, explain:
1. The likely attack scenario or system issue that could explain these anomalies
2. Whether these anomalies appear to be related or independent issues
3. The potential impact to system security and operations
4. Priority level for investigation and response

Provide a concise, actionable interpretation of these anomalies that would help a security team understand the situation and determine appropriate next steps.
