As a security analyst, I need to explain the following process anomaly:

Process Information:
CMD: {raw_data.get("CMD", "Unknown")}
PID: {raw_data.get("PID", "Unknown")}
CPU Usage: {raw_data.get("CPU", "Unknown")}
Runtime: {raw_data.get("TRUN", "Unknown")}

Anomaly Detection:
- This process has been flagged as anomalous with a probability of {probability:.2f}
- The process may be exhibiting unusual CPU usage patterns, runtime behavior, or state transitions
- Look for unexpected high CPU usage, unusual execution time, or abnormal process states
- Potential issues could include crypto miners, background malicious processes, or system resource abuse

Based on the provided data, explain what makes this process suspicious, what potential threats it might represent, and what a security analyst should look for when investigating this alert.
