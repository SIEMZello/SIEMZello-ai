As a security analyst, I need to explain the following memory usage anomaly:

Memory Information:
CMD: {raw_data.get("CMD", "Unknown")}
DSK: {raw_data.get("DSK", "Unknown")}
RDDSK: {raw_data.get("RDDSK", "Unknown")}
WRDSK: {raw_data.get("WRDSK", "Unknown")}

Anomaly Detection:
- This memory activity has been flagged as anomalous with a probability of {probability:.2f}
- The system may be exhibiting unusual memory usage patterns, read/write operations, or allocation behaviors
- Look for unexpected memory consumption, unusual read/write patterns, or memory leaks
- Potential issues could include memory-based attacks, resource exhaustion, or application vulnerabilities

Based on the provided data, explain what makes this memory activity suspicious, what potential threats it might represent, and what a security analyst should look for when investigating this alert.
