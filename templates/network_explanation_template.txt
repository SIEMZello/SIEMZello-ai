As a security analyst, I need to explain the following network traffic alert:

Network Traffic Information:
Duration: {raw_data.get("dur", "Unknown")}
Protocol: {raw_data.get("proto", "Unknown")}
Service: {raw_data.get("service", "Unknown")}
State: {raw_data.get("state", "Unknown")}

Attack Detection:
- This network traffic has been flagged as potentially malicious with a probability of {probability:.2f}
- Attack Type: {detection_result.get("attack_type", "Unknown")}
- Attack Type Probabilities: {detection_result.get("attack_type_probabilities", {})}
- The traffic may be exhibiting patterns consistent with known attack signatures

Look for:
- Unusual connection patterns or protocol mismatches
- Unexpected service usage or connection states
- Potentially malicious source/destination combinations
- Connection attempts to known malicious endpoints

Based on the provided data, explain what makes this network traffic suspicious, what type of attack it most likely represents, and what a security analyst should investigate to confirm the nature of this threat.
